# DataSpace_Valorization_Cases
Four valorization cases leveraging on data exchange from the InterSTORE DataSpace are presented for the InterSTORE partners. The first 3 have a user interface, to which the user only needs to access the URL provided in the corresponding .txt file. For the 4th valorization case, the backend code is provided, acknowledging that many adaptations will have to be made to each specific battery, system and dataset. However the methodology is provided with an example which the user will have to update as he finds fit. The valorization cases were thought as examples to be applied to the data shared from the assets that are present in the demonstration sites.

1 - Valorization Case 1 - Battery Dispatch Optimization
2 - Valorization Case 2 - Green EV charging Ranking
3 - Valorization Case 3 - Solar PV performance Analysis
4 - Valorization Case 4 - Anomaly detection of Battery Storage Systems

Data used being shared through the dataspaces in each use case:
Valorization Case 1 - Each battery operator may download from the DataSpace the forecasted Day-ahead emissions and Day-ahead prices for its zone as incentives and include them as inputs in the tool. The Weather forecast data is also provided in case the user needs it to forecast its load consumption (such as a building), but this load forecast is on the side of the user.

Valorization Case 2 - Green EV charging Ranking - A set of users come together and their eachothers data regarding EV charging sessions in their location. With the CO2 Emissions which can be downloaded from the Dataspace for each location, the user can compare the environmental behavior of the chargings in its location in comparison to other companies/locations. This provides a gamification approach and an incentive for collective behavioral change towards green charging.

Valorization Case 3 - Solar PV performance Analysis. In this case the users share their PV generation profiles, if in the same location (e.g.: Renewable Energy Communities), and evaluate their PV performance based on generation output against eachother (baseline). A lower performance may indicate the need for maintenance of the panels, such as cleaning or orientation. In this case since the InterSTORE partners are in different countries, the baseline is provided by the PVGIS tool by the JRC for each corresponding location.

Valorization Case 4 - Anomaly detection of Battery Storage Systems. Partners share battery operation data to validate the anomaly detection model. A challenge in this types of models is lack of abnormal observation which could validadte the true positive metric of the model. Sharing data allows training and testing of the model and provides the change to experiment with other technologies.
